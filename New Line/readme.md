# Hello World Program in C++

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic input and output operations using `cout` for printing text to the console. It includes examples of new lines, tabs, escape characters, and special characters.

## Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Adding new line
    cout << "Hello world \n\n\n";
    cout << "Welcome to logic with manan";

    cout << "Please \t\t like this video";
    cout << "Please like this \\\\ video";

    cout << "We are \"good\" to GO";
    return 0;
}
```

## How to Run

1. **Install a C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows).
2. **Save the code** in a file named `hello_world.cpp`.
3. **Open a terminal** or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. **Compile the code** using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
   ```
5. **Run the compiled program** using:
   ```bash
   ./hello_world
   ```

## Expected Output

When you run the program, it will display the following output:

```
Hello world


Welcome to logic with manan
Please         like this video
Please like this \\ video
We are "good" to GO
```

## Explanation

- **New Lines (`\n`)**: Adds new lines in the output.
- **Tabs (`\t`)**: Adds horizontal tabs in the output.
- **Escape Characters (`\\` and `\"`)**: Demonstrates how to use escape characters to print backslashes and quotes.
