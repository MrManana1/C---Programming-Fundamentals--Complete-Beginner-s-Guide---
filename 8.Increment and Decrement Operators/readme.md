# Prefix and Postfix Increment/Decrement Operations in C++

This program demonstrates the use of prefix and postfix increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operations on an integer variable.

## Operations Covered

- **Prefix Increment**: Increments the value of a variable before assigning it.
- **Postfix Increment**: Assigns the current value of a variable and then increments it.
- **Prefix Decrement**: Decrements the value of a variable before assigning it.
- **Postfix Decrement**: Assigns the current value of a variable and then decrements it.

## Expected Output

The program performs the operations on `a = 10` and displays the following results:

```
After prefix Increment of a = 11, b = 11
After postfix Increment of a = 12, b = 11
After prefix Decrement of a = 11, b = 11
After postfix Decrement of a = 10, b = 11
```

## Explanation

- **Prefix Increment/Decrement (`++a` / `--a`)**: The value of `a` is modified before being assigned to `b`.
- **Postfix Increment/Decrement (`a++` / `a--`)**: The value of `a` is first assigned to `b`, then modified.
