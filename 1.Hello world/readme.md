# Our First Program in C++

Welcome to the "Our First Program in C++" repository!

This repository contains a simple C++ program that serves as an introduction to basic C++ syntax. It demonstrates how to write and execute your first C++ program, which prints "Hello world" to the console.

## Code Overview

```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Hello world";
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

- `#include<iostream>`: Includes the input-output stream library, which allows us to use `cout`.
- `using namespace std;`: This statement allows us to use standard library features without prefixing them with `std::`.
- `int main()`: The main function where the program starts execution.
- `cout << "Hello world";`: Prints the string "Hello world" to the console.
- `return 0;`: Indicates that the program ended successfully.

## Getting Started

To run this program:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrManana1/C---Programming-Fundamentals--Complete-Beginner-s-Guide---.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd C---Programming-Fundamentals--Complete-Beginner-s-Guide---
   ```

3. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   g++ -o hello hello.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Executable:**
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

You should see "Hello world" printed to the console.
