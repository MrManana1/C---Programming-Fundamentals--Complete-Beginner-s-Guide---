# Simple Addition Program in C++

This C++ program takes two floating-point numbers as input from the user and calculates their sum. The program then displays the sum of the two numbers.

## Expected Output

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter two numbers, then display their sum:

```
Please enter your first number: [User enters num_1]
Enter your second number: [User enters num_2]
Sum of [num_1] and [num_2] is = [sum]
```

## Explanation

- **float**: Used to store floating-point numbers (decimal values).
- **cin**: Used for taking input from the user.
- **cout**: Used for displaying output to the console.
- **int sum**: Although declared as `int`, the variable `sum` is calculated from two `float` values, which may cause unexpected results if the sum includes a decimal value. This can be fixed by declaring `sum` as a `float`.
