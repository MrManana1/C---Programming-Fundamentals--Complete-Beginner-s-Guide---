# Arithmetic and Compound Assignment Operators in C++

This program demonstrates the use of arithmetic and compound assignment operators by calculating the difference between two integers.

## Operations Covered

- **Arithmetic Operator**: Subtracts one integer from another using the `-` operator.
- **Compound Assignment Operator**: Subtracts one integer from another and assigns the result using the `-=` operator.

## Expected Output

The program calculates the difference between `a = 11` and `b = 12` using both types of operators, displaying the following results:

```
Difference of 11 and 12 Using Arithmetic operators: -1
Difference of 11 and 12 Using Compound assignment operators: -1
```

## Explanation

- **Arithmetic Operator (`a - b`)**: Directly subtracts the value of `b` from `a`.
- **Compound Assignment Operator (`a -= b`)**: Subtracts the value of `b` from `a` and assigns the result back to `a`.
