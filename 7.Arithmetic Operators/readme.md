# Basic Arithmetic Operations in C++

This program performs basic arithmetic operations between two integers (`a = 9` and `b = 2`) and displays the results for the following operations:

- **Sum**: Adds two integers.
- **Difference**: Subtracts one integer from another.
- **Product**: Multiplies two integers.
- **Division**: Divides one integer by another.
- **Modulo**: Finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another.

## Expected Output

The program will output the following results for `a = 9` and `b = 2`:

```
Sum of a and b = 11
Difference of a and b = 7
Product of a and b = 18
Division of a and b = 4
Module of a and b = 1
```

## Explanation

- **int a, int b**: Two integer variables used for the arithmetic operations.
- **cout**: Used to display the results of the operations.
