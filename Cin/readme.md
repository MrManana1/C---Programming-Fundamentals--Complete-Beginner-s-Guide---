# Simple User Input Program in C++

This C++ program demonstrates how to take user input using `cin` and display the input using `cout`. The program asks the user to enter their name and age, then outputs the provided information.




## Expected Output

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age, then display the entered information:

```
Please enter your Name: [User enters name]
Your name is: [User's name]
Please Enter your age: [User enters age]
Your age is: [User's age]
```

## Explanation

- **cin**: Used for taking input from the user.
- **cout**: Used for displaying output to the console.
- **string**: Used to store text (in this case, the user's name).
- **int**: Used to store integer values (in this case, the user's age).
